To answer that age old question that perhaps all of us have asked ourselves at
some point in our lives: "What is wrong with me?"


=== Setup

First, get Ruby 1.9.1 up and running.

  % [sudo] gem install rvm
  % rvm-install
  % rvm install 1.9.1
  % rvm 1.9.1


Then, prepare the application.

  % git submodule update --init
  % gem install bundler
  % bundle install
  % cp config/database.yml.example config/database.yml
  % rake db:create:all db:migrate
