    all of us have asked ourselves at some point in our lives.

    "What is wrong with me?"

    Of course, nobody is perfect. We all have our own idiosyncrasies and
    personality flaws. Think of the people you know. We are sure you can theirs.
    I bet they can identify yours as well.

    Create a profile and invite people to leave anonymous constructive criticism
    about your character. We all want to improve, don't we?

  <h2>How does it all work?</h2>
  <h3>It's ridiculously easy. Totally anonymous.</h3>
  <ol>
    <li><strong>Sign up</strong> for a free account</li>
    <li><strong>Fill out</strong> your profile</li>
    <li>Announce your URL! Tweet it, post it on Facebook. <strong>Get it out there!</strong></li>
    <li>Sit back and <strong>brace yourself</strong> for honesty you've never gotten before.</li>
  </ol>
  <p>
    Once you start receiving the anonymous feedback, you'll be able to categorize it, and you and your friends
    will be able to agree or disagree, leave comments, and work together to improve your
    personal character! Once they create their account, don't forget to return the favor!
  </p>
  <p>
    When you sign up, you'll be asked for a piece of information that only your friends know.
    This way, you can be sure that only people who know you can write on your profile.
  </p>
