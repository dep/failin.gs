    <p><strong>failin.gs</strong> is a community where you can have your friends
    anonymously critique you.</p>

    <p>It's important, though, to make sure that the people who leave you
    feedback actually do know who you are.</p>

    <p>When someone leaves feedback on you, they will be asked for your last
    name. Maybe not perfect, but it will keep a lot of fakes at bay.</p>

    <p>You'll have a chance to respond to everyone's feedback. You can even flag
    things that you think are fake.</p>

    <p>Don't worry. Your last name will not be viewable to anyone.</p>
